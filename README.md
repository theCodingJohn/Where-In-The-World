# Where in the World?

The user should be able to: 
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field 
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
